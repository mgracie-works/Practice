            <p>Once upon a time, there was a little fox playing with her friends on the pond in the middle 
            of the Forest of Enigma. While the little animal friends were playing, came a calling mother of a young foal.</p>
            <p>"Time to eat, my dear Fo.", the mother said.</p>
            <p>"Coming mother!", the young foal responded.</p>
